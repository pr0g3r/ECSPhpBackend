#+TITLE: Elixir Customer Services Frontend

* Deployment
To deploy the front end either locally or on the main Elixir server, you will need to create a .env file which will store the required endpoints for api calls. Below for example is the .env which I use for local development, create your own in the root of the frontend folder.
#+begin_src bash
  VITE_API_URL='http://127.0.0.1:8000/'
  VITE_FESP_URL='http://localhost/Projects/index.php'
  VITE_BASE_URL='http://127.0.0.1/'
#+end_src
